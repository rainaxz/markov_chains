Project Description

    This project provides solutions for analyzing both ergodic and absorbing Markov chains using various methods. The implementation includes:

    Ergodic Eigenvector Solution
    Ergodic Matrix Multiplication Solution
    Ergodic Simulation Solution
    Absorbing CK-Equation Solution
    Absorbing Simulation Solution

Files and Directories

    markovChains.py
    simulate.py

Usage
    
    To run the program, execute the following command:
    
      python simulate.py

Notes

    The simulation methods run multiple iterations to estimate the probabilities. You can adjust the number of iterations if needed.
